# NAME

Syntax::Keyword::Assert - assert keyword for Perl with zero runtime cost

# SYNOPSIS

```perl
use Syntax::Keyword::Assert;

assert { 1 >= 10 };
# => Assertion failed (1 >= 10)
```

# DESCRIPTION

Syntax::Keyword::Assert provides a syntax extension for Perl that introduces a `assert` keyword.

By default assertions are enabled, but can be disabled by setting `$ENV{PERL_ASSERT_ENABLED}` to false before this module is loaded:

```
BEGIN { $ENV{PERL_ASSERT_ENABLED} = 0 }  # Disable assertions
```

When assertions are disabled, the `assert` are completely ignored at compile phase, resulting in zero runtime cost. This makes Syntax::Keyword::Assert ideal for use in production environments, as it does not introduce any performance penalties when assertions are not needed.

# KEYWORDS

## assert

```
assert(EXPR)
```

If EXPR is trusy in scalar context, then happens nothing. Otherwise, it dies with a user-friendly error message.

Here are some examples:

```perl
assert("apple" eq "banana");  # => Assertion failed ("apple" eq "banana")
assert(123 != 123);           # => Assertion failed (123 != 123)
assert(1 > 10);               # => Assertion failed (1 > 10)
```

    This module also uses keyword plugin, but it depends on [Keyword::Simple](https://metacpan.org/pod/Keyword%3A%3ASimple). And this module's error message does not include the failed expression.

- [Devel::Assert](https://metacpan.org/pod/Devel%3A%3AAssert)

    This module provides a similar functionality, but it dose not use a keyword plugin.
