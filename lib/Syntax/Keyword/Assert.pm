=head1 NAME

Syntax::Keyword::Assert - assert keyword for Perl with zero runtime cost

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Syntax::Keyword::Assert;

    assert { 1 >= 10 };
    # => Assertion failed (1 >= 10)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Syntax::Keyword::Assert provides a syntax extension for Perl that introduces a C<assert> keyword.

By default assertions are enabled, but can be disabled by setting C<$ENV{PERL_ASSERT_ENABLED}> to false before this module is loaded:

    BEGIN { $ENV{PERL_ASSERT_ENABLED} = 0 }  # Disable assertions

When assertions are disabled, the C<assert> are completely ignored at compile phase, resulting in zero runtime cost. This makes Syntax::Keyword::Assert ideal for use in production environments, as it does not introduce any performance penalties when assertions are not needed.

=head1 KEYWORDS

=head2 assert

    assert(EXPR)

If EXPR is truthy in scalar context, then happens nothing. Otherwise, it dies with a user-friendly error message.

Here are some examples:

    assert("apple" eq "banana");  # => Assertion failed ("apple" eq "banana")
    assert(123 != 123);           # => Assertion failed (123 != 123)
    assert(1 > 10);               # => Assertion failed (1 > 10)

=item L<PerlX::Assert>

This module also uses keyword plugin, but it depends on L<Keyword::Simple>. And this module's error message does not include the failed expression.

=item L<Devel::Assert>

This module provides a similar functionality, but it dose not use a keyword plugin.
